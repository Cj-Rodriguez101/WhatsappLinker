## Description
A Small utility Android application to chat with a phone number on whatsapp, without first saving the number as a contact.

The idea was to show a notification whenever a number is copied(added to clipboard), and then a click on that notification would deep-link the user to whatsapp.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a better means of recongising string as a phone number
- [ ] Add Setup for more localities other than Nigeria
- [ ] Monitor Clipboard, if possible
- [ ] Show notification when number copied
- [x] Add app to telephone action intent app chooser

Feel free to make a PR to this repository if you can complete any of these tasks or add support for a new nationality
